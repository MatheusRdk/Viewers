  <h1>OHIF Medical Imaging Viewer and Disease button Extension</h1>
  <p><strong>The OHIF Viewer</strong> is a zero-footprint medical image viewer
provided by the <a href="https://ohif.org/">Open Health Imaging Foundation (OHIF)</a>. It is a configurable and extensible progressive web application with out-of-the-box support for image archives which support <a href="https://www.dicomstandard.org/using/dicomweb/">DICOMweb</a>.</p>
 <p>In this project, i created a test extension that adds disease severity level buttons to the left panel of the OHIF basic viewer. These buttons are intended to be stored as a medical observation in the study attributes in DCM4CHEE, assuming it is used as a DICOMWeb server.</p>
